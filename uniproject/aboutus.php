                    Our team works with the country’s largest employers and their staff to make the workplace the safest environment it can be. We also work with SMEs, assisting these vital companies to leverage services and support ensuring employee safety.                 
                  </p>  
                 <p>   Founded in 2005, we are the only charitable organisation working on a business-to-business platform to advise companies in addressing and mitigating the risk domestic violence poses to their company and employees. Statistically speaking, 1 in 4 women and 1 in 6 men are affected by domestic violence. 75% of people enduring violence are targeted at work, through social media, site visits, phone calls and a myriad of other ways.
                   </p>             
                   <p> We reach 5,000,000 employees in the private, public and third sector per year, and successfully assist in the reduction of the calculated cost domestic violence has to the UK economy, which was an estimated £1.9bn per year of taxpayers money.</p>

                 <p>    The Alliance commissioned the first of its kind research into employer understanding of domestic violence and the impact in the workplace. Our research indicated that 87% of employers wanted to address domestic violence. To meet that need, we trained over 10,000 employees. Not knowing how to get help, we are here, to educate you in how to save lives in your workplace.
                     <br> To mitigate the corporate risk, we work directly with employers to make a scalable difference to the health, work and wellbeing of their employees. We do not serve as counselors, instead we provide accredited training to employees where they can learn how to identify warning signs, know what the best practice is and take action internally.           
                       <br> In one year we assisted companies to act on 128 disclosures made by employees about incidents of domestic violence who required immediate support for their safety, including people who witness and perpetrate.  All of the employees are safe, their families safe, and remain in work.</p>
